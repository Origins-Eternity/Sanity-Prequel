## Introduction
**Added minerals, materials, and useful features needed for technological development to the Evolution: Reset Pack. Utilities are enabled by default, but all items, blocks, fluids and other contents need to be enabled in the configuration file. Mods are already included in and mainly applies to the modpack, but you can also use it in your game if you like. But you won't have the full experience of it.**  
## Feature  
**The compatibility of these features is unknown, and some features are designed specifically for the modpack described above. Configurations are already available for some features, which can be highly customizable. If you encounter any problems, please feel free to give feedback.**
### Endurance  
**Inspired by the StaminaPlus mod, each survival/adventure player has their own endurance level, you can choose whether to display the HUD in the configuration file.**

### Language Automatically Set  
**Mod will attempt to set the game language to the corresponding language based on the detected system language. Only Chinese are supported by default, you can add the desired language in the configuration file. Notice, the feature will not work when installed RandomPatches at the same time.**  
### No Infinite Fluids  
**All fluids in the game cannot create new fluid resources, but players can still bottle water with water.**

### Replace The Products of Lava and Water  
**When lava and water meets, the original obsidian will be replaced with basalt blocks.**  
### Default World Type  
**It's not really a change, but rather swapping the RTG world type with the default world type. Valid only when Realistic Terrain Generation and other fork version which has the same modid is installed.**  
### Regeneration  
**When the player uses an item, if the mod detects an increase in the player's maxhealth, it will give the Regeneration II buff for 10 seconds. Valid only when First Aid is installed at the same time, and can be turned off in the configuration file.**  
### Maxhealth Fix  
**This is a fix for First Aid. These issues arise when installing First Aid and other mods that have the ability to increase the player's maxhealth at the same time. This mod currently fixes an issue where players have less health when re-entering a world or returning to the Overworld from the End, and can not gain maxhealth when respawning.**  
## Content  
**All content is also designed for the above modpack, you can customize what should be added in the configuration file, and all content will not be added by default.**  
### Ores  
**A total of three ores have been added, tin, copper, and tungsten. All ores are only spawned in the Overworld. Each ore has a corresponding fluid and mineral word added.**

**With the exception of tungsten ore, the mod does not add ingots, nuggets and smelting recipes to other ores. Only some fluids have been added to the smelter recipe. However, all ores will spawn and drop in the world normally.**  
### Blueprints  
**Blueprints are the tools needed to craft some items in the above modpack, and each blueprint has 10 durability. Mod doesn't add recipes to these blueprints, the textures come from the Artisan Worktables.**  
### Tinker's material  
**A new tinker's material,  Tungsten Steel, has been added, only when Tinkers' Construct 2 is installed. If you enable this, be sure to enable Items, Fluids, and Ores.**
